This repository contains the prototype system for our OSDI 2020 paper:
[Fault-tolerant and Transactional Stateful Serverless Workflows](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/zhang-haoran).


## How to run our code and reproduce our results 
See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for a detailed description of 
how to set up our code, run our experiments, and reproduce our results.

Our code runs on Amazon AWS Lambda without additional requirements or
dependencies.
